# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to connect your local project to a GitHub repository:

## Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter "ux-idx" as the repository name
4. Add the description: "User management dashboard for IDX Real Estate Solution"
5. Choose "Public" visibility
6. Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have files)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will display commands to push your existing repository. Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as a remote named "origin"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ux-idx.git

# Push your local commits to the GitHub repository
git push -u origin main
```

Replace "yourusername" with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 3: Verify the Setup

After pushing your code, refresh the GitHub repository page in your browser. You should see all your project files, including the README.md with the dashboard description.

## Step 4: Future Pushes

For future changes, you can simply use:

```bash
git push
```
