## 📚 Developer Documentation

### 1. Setup Guide

#### Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add the required secrets:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_REBNY_API_KEY=your_key_here
SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_key_here
```

#### Start Development
```bash

```

### 2. Demo Credentials
For testing the client-side dashboard, use the following credentials:

**Email:** `demo@idxsolution.com`  
**Password:** `IDX@demo2023`

This demo account provides access to the full dashboard functionality, including saved properties, saved searches, notifications, and profile settings without needing to set up a real database.

### 3. API Endpoints
Use Swagger to document endpoints:
- `/api/properties` – Search properties with query parameters (location, price_min/max, etc.)
- `/api/properties/{id}` – Get details for a specific property
- `/api/agents` – List real estate agents
- `/api/agents/{id}` – Get details for a specific agent

Example Swagger Spec (in docs/swagger.json):
```json
{
  "openapi": "3.0.0",
  "paths": {
    "/api/properties": {
      "get": {
        "summary": "Search properties via REBNY IDX API",
        "parameters": [
          { "name": "location", "in": "query", "required": false },
          { "name": "price_min", "in": "query", "required": false },
          { "name": "price_max", "in": "query", "required": false }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Webflow Integration
Embed React components in Webflow by:
- Exporting components as static HTML/CSS via Next.js API routes
- Using Webflow's "Custom Code" feature to inject your component into pages
- Implementing client-side hydration for interactive elements

### 5. Security Best Practices
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints
- **Data Encryption**: Use Supabase's built-in encryption for sensitive data
- **API Key Management**: Store API keys securely using environment variables
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs with zod or similar validation libraries
- **CORS Policies**: Configure proper CORS policies for API endpoints

### 6. Deployment
- **Staging Environment**: Deploy to Vercel preview environments for testing
- **Production**: Use Vercel for production deployment
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

GitHub Actions workflow example:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy IDX App

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
